VA tête-bêche book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between).
p24
aVThe main drawback of the "Ace Double" format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit.
p25
aVDespite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr was the editor.
p26
aVThe American company was founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn and began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns.
