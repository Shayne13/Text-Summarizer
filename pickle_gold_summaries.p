VSMS König Albert ("His Majesty's Ship King Albert")[a] was the fourth vessel of the Kaiser\ufffdclass of battleships of the Imperial German Navy.
p2
aV[b] König Albert's keel was laid on 17 July 1910 at the Schichau-Werke dockyard in Danzig.
p3
aVShe was launched on 27 April 1912 and was commissioned into the fleet on 31 July 1913.
p4
aVThe ship was equipped with ten 30.5-centimeter (12.0\ufffdin) guns in five twin turrets, and had a top speed of 22.1 knots (40.9\ufffdkm/h; 25.4\ufffdmph).
p5
aVKönig Albert was assigned to the III Battle Squadron and later the IV Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career, including World War I.
p6
aVAlong with her four sister ships, Kaiser, Friedrich der Grosse, Kaiserin, and Prinzregent Luitpold, König Albert participated in most of the major fleet operations of World War I, though she was in drydock for maintenance during the Battle of Jutland between 31 May and 1 June 1916.
p7
aVAs a result, she was the only battleship actively serving with the fleet that missed the largest naval battle of the war.
p8
aVThe ship was also involved in Operation Albion, an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, in late 1917.
p9
aVAfter Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, König Albert and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow.
p10
aVThe ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles.
p11
aVOn 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships.
p12
aVKönig Albert was raised in July 1935 and subsequently broken up for scrap in 1936.

VThe Madagascan sunset moth (Chrysiridia rhipheus) is a day-flying moth of the family Uraniidae.
p15
aVIt is considered one of the most impressive and appealing-looking lepidopterans.
p16
aVFamous worldwide, it is featured in most coffee table books on Lepidoptera and is much sought after by collectors.
p17
aVIt is very colourful, though the iridescent parts of the wings do not have pigment; rather the colours originate from optical interference.
p18
aVAdults have a wingspan of 7\u20139\ufffdcm (2.8\u20133.5\ufffdin).
p19
aVDru Drury, who described the moth in 1773, placed it in the genus Papilio, considering it a butterfly.
p20
aVJacob Hübner placed it in the moth genus Chrysiridia in 1823.
p21
aVLater redescriptions led to junior synonyms such as Chrysiridia madagascariensis (Lesson, 1831).
p22
aVAt first the moth was thought to be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar.
p23
aVIt is found throughout the year in most parts of the island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December.
p24
aVFemales lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp.
p25
aVThe caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae.
p26
aVSilk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold onto smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall.
p27
aVAfter completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon.
p28
aVThe pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.
p29
aVChrysiridia rhipheus is the sole specialist herbivore of the four species of Omphalea in Madagascar.
p30
aVOmphalea is toxic: the toxins are sequestered by the feeding caterpillar and retained in the pupal and adult stages.
p31
aVThousands of these moths migrate between the eastern and western ranges of their host plants.

VThe United States Bicentennial coinage was a set of circulating commemorative coins, consisting of a quarter, half dollar and dollar struck by the United States Mint in 1975 and 1976.
p34
aVRegardless of when struck, each coin bears the double date 1776\u20131976 on the normal obverses for the Washington quarter, Kennedy half dollar and Eisenhower dollar.
p35
aVNo coins dated 1975 of any of the three denominations were minted.
p36
aVGiven past abuses in the system, the Mint advocated against the issuance of commemorative coins starting in the 1950s.
p37
aVBeginning in 1971, members of Congress introduced bills to authorize coins to honor the United States Bicentennial, which would occur in 1976.
p38
aVThe Mint, through its director, Mary Brooks, initially opposed such proposals, but later supported them, and Congress passed legislation requiring the temporary redesign of the reverse of the quarter, half dollar and dollar.
p39
aVA nationwide competition resulted in designs of a Colonial drummer for the quarter, Independence Hall for the half dollar and the Liberty Bell superimposed against the moon for the dollar.
p40
aVAll three coins remain common today, due to the quantity struck.
p41
aVCirculation pieces were in copper nickel; Congress also mandated 45,000,000 part-silver pieces be struck for collectors.
p42
aVThe Mint sold over half of the part-silver coins before melting the remainder after withdrawing them from sale in 1986.
p43
aVDue to the large mintage, the pieces remain common today, and the quarter can still be found in circulation.

VThe Saxbe fix, or salary rollback, is a mechanism by which the President of the United States, in appointing a current or former member of the United States Congress whose elected term has not yet expired, can avoid the restriction of the United States Constitution's Ineligibility Clause.
p46
aVThat clause prohibits the President from appointing a current or former member of Congress to a civil office position that was created, or to a civil office position for which the pay and/or benefits (collectively, "emoluments") were increased, during the term for which that member was elected until the term has expired.
p47
aVThe rollback, first implemented by an Act of Congress in 1909, reverts the emoluments of the office to the amount they were when that member began his or her elected term.
p48
aVTo prevent ethical conflicts, James Madison proposed language at the Constitutional Convention that was adopted as the Ineligibility Clause after debate and modification by other Founding Fathers.
p49
aVHistorically, a number of approaches have been taken to address the problem posed by restriction; these have included choosing another nominee, allowing the desired nominee's elected term of office to expire, ignoring the clause entirely, or reducing the offending emoluments to the level prior to when the nominee took office.
p50
aVAlthough Congress passed the mechanism reducing emoluments in 1909, the procedure was named "Saxbe fix" after Senator William Saxbe, who was confirmed as Attorney General in 1973 after Congress reduced the office's salary to the level it had been before Saxbe's term commenced.
p51
aVThe Saxbe fix has subsequently become relevant as a successful\u2014though not universally accepted\u2014solution for appointments by presidents of both parties of sitting members of the United States Congress to the United States Cabinet.
p52
aVMembers of Congress have been appointed to federal judgeships without any fix being enacted; court challenges to such appointments have failed.
p53
aVThere were four Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to Barack Obama.
p54
aVThe first two rollbacks concerned appointees of Republicans William Howard Taft and Richard Nixon, and the last two were implemented for appointees of Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.
p55
aVCongress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees.
p56
aVSince the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to the conclusion of the term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected.
p57
aVThe Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.

VThe Battle of Towton was fought during the English Wars of the Roses on 29 March 1461, near the village of the same name in Yorkshire.
p60
aVIt was the "largest and bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil".
p61
aVAccording to chroniclers, more than 50,000\ufffdsoldiers from the Houses of York and Lancaster fought for hours amidst a snowstorm on that day, which was Palm Sunday.
p62
aVA newsletter circulated a week after the battle reported that 28,000 died on the battlefield.
p63
aVThe engagement brought about a monarchical change in England\u2014Edward IV displaced Henry VI as King of England, driving the head of the Lancastrians and his key supporters out of the country.
p64
aVContemporary accounts described Henry VI as peaceful and pious, not suited for the violent dynastic civil wars, such as the War of the Roses.
p65
aVHe suffered from periods of insanity while his inherent benevolence eventually required his wife, Margaret of Anjou, to assume control of his kingdom, which contributed to his own downfall.
p66
aVHis ineffectual rule had encouraged the nobles' schemes to establish control over him, and the situation deteriorated into a civil war between the supporters of his house and those of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York.
p67
aVAfter the Yorkists captured Henry in 1460, the English parliament passed an Act of Accord to let York and his line succeed Henry as king.
p68
aVHenry's consort, Margaret of Anjou, refused to accept the dispossession of her son's right to the throne and, along with fellow Lancastrian malcontents, raised an army.
p69
aVRichard of York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield and his titles, including the claim to the throne, passed to his eldest son Edward.
p70
aVNobles, who were previously hesitant to support Richard's claim to the throne, regarded the Lancastrians to have reneged on the Act\u2014a legal agreement\u2014and Edward found enough backing to denounce Henry and declare himself king.
p71
aVThe Battle of Towton was to affirm the victor's right to rule over England through force of arms.
p72
aVOn reaching the battlefield, the Yorkists found themselves heavily outnumbered.
p73
aVPart of their force under John de Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, had yet to arrive.
p74
aVThe Yorkist leader Lord Fauconberg turned the tables by ordering his archers to take advantage of the strong wind to outrange their enemies.
p75
aVThe one-sided missile exchange\u2014Lancastrian arrows fell short of the Yorkist ranks\u2014provoked the Lancastrians into abandoning their defensive positions.
p76
aVThe ensuing hand-to-hand combat lasted hours, exhausting the combatants.
p77
aVThe arrival of Norfolk's men reinvigorated the Yorkists and, encouraged by Edward, they routed their foes.
p78
aVMany Lancastrians were killed while fleeing; some trampled each other and others drowned in the rivers.
p79
aVSeveral who were taken as prisoners were executed.
p80
aVThe power of the House of Lancaster was severely reduced after this battle.
p81
aVHenry fled the country, and many of his most powerful followers were dead or in exile after the engagement, letting Edward rule England uninterrupted for nine\ufffdyears, before a brief restoration of Henry to the throne.
p82
aVLater generations remembered the battle as depicted in William Shakespeare's dramatic adaptation of Henry's life\u2014Henry VI, Part 3, Act\ufffd2, Scene\ufffd5.
p83
aVIn 1929, the Towton Cross was erected on the battlefield to commemorate the event.

VA Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) is a political pamphlet, written by the 18th-century British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, which attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism.
p87
aVWollstonecraft's was the first response in a pamphlet war sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), a defence of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England.
p88
aVWollstonecraft attacked not only hereditary privilege, but also the rhetoric that Burke used to defend it.
p89
aVMost of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language.
p90
aVBy saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric as well as his argument.
p91
aVIn her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.
p92
aVIn her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners.
p93
aVDriven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom.
p94
aVShe describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs.
p95
aVWollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.
p96
aVThe Rights of Men was successful: it was reviewed by every major periodical of the day and the first edition sold out in three weeks.
p97
aVHowever, upon the publication of the second edition (the first to carry Wollstonecraft's name on the title page), the reviews began to evaluate the text not only as a political pamphlet but also as the work of a female writer.
p98
aVThey contrasted Wollstonecraft's "passion" with Burke's "reason" and spoke condescendingly of the text and its female author.
p99
aVThis analysis of the Rights of Men prevailed until the 1970s, when feminist scholars began to read Wollstonecraft's texts with more care and called attention to their intellectualism.

VCharles Henry Holden, Litt.
p102
aVD., FRIBA, MRTPI, RDI (12 May 1875 \u2013 1 May 1960) was a Bolton-born English architect best known for designing many London Underground stations during the 1920s and 1930s, for Bristol Central Library, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London's headquarters at 55 Broadway and for the University of London's Senate House.
p103
aVHe also created many war cemeteries in Belgium and northern France for the Imperial War Graves Commission.
p104
aVAfter working and training in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London.
p105
aVHis early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, but for most of his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing.
p106
aV[note 1] He believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by the intended functions of buildings.
p107
aVAfter the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture.
p108
aVHolden was a member of the Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild.
p109
aVHe produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.
p110
aVAlthough not without its critics, his architecture is widely appreciated.
p111
aVHe was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA's) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1943.
p112
aVHis station designs for London Underground became the corporation's standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s.
p113
aVMany of his buildings have been granted listed building status, protecting them from unapproved alteration.
p114
aVModestly believing that architecture was a collaborative effort, he twice declined the offer of a knighthood.

VEdward Teller (Hungarian: Teller\ufffdEde; January 15, 1908\ufffd\u2013 September 9, 2003) was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist, known colloquially as "the father of the hydrogen bomb", even though he claimed he did not care for the title.
p117
aVTeller made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (the Jahn\u2013Teller and Renner\u2013Teller effects), and surface physics.
p118
aVHis extension of Fermi's theory of beta decay (in the form of the so-called Gamow\u2013Teller transitions) provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory.
p119
aVThe Jahn\u2013Teller effect and the BET theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.
p120
aVTeller also made contributions to Thomas\u2013Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules.
p121
aVIn 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.
p122
aVTeller emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, and was an early member of the Manhattan Project charged with developing the first atomic bombs.
p123
aVDuring this time he made a serious push to develop the first fusion-based weapons as well, but these were deferred until after World War II.
p124
aVAfter his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former Los Alamos colleague J. Robert Oppenheimer, Teller was ostracized by much of the scientific community.
p125
aVHe continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program.
p126
aVHe was a co-founder of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and was both its director and associate director for many years.
p127
aVIn his later years he became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using thermonuclear explosive in what was called Project Chariot.
p128
aVHe was a vigorous advocate of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
p129
aVThroughout his life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality, and is considered one of the inspirations for the character Dr. Strangelove in the 1964 movie of the same name.

VSirius is the brightest star in the night sky.
p132
aVWith a visual apparent magnitude of \u22121.46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star.
p133
aVThe name "Sirius" is derived from the Ancient Greek: \u03a3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 Seirios ("glowing" or "scorcher").
p134
aVThe star has the Bayer designation Alpha Canis Majoris (\u03b1 CMa).
p135
aVWhat the naked eye perceives as a single star is actually a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type A1V, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B.
p136
aVThe distance separating Sirius A from its companion varies between 8.1 and 31.5 AU.
p137
aVSirius appears bright because of both its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to Earth.
p138
aVAt a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbors; for Northern-hemisphere observers between 30 degrees and 73 degrees of latitude (including almost all of Europe and North America), it is the closest star (after the Sun) that can be seen with a naked eye.
p139
aVSirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years.
p140
aVAfter that time its distance will begin to recede, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's sky for the next 210,000 years.
p141
aVSirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun and has an absolute visual magnitude of 1.42.
p142
aVIt is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel.
p143
aVThe system is between 200 and 300 million years old.
p144
aVIt was originally composed of two bright bluish stars.
p145
aVThe more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120 million years ago.
p146
aVSirius is also known colloquially as the "Dog Star", reflecting its prominence in its constellation, Canis Major (Greater Dog).
p147
aVThe heliacal rising of Sirius marked the flooding of the Nile in Ancient Egypt and the "dog days" of summer for the ancient Greeks, while to the Polynesians it marked winter and was an important star for navigation around the Pacific Ocean.
