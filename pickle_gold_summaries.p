aVHe was an important figure of the Russian avant garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the former Soviet Union.
p25
aVHis work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.
p26
aVEl Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, "das zielbewuﬂte Schaffen" (goal-oriented creation).

VSonatas and Interludes is a collection of twenty pieces for prepared piano by American avant-garde composer John Cage (1912\u20131992).
p35
aVIt was composed in 1946\u20131948, shortly after Cage's introduction to Indian philosophy and the teachings of art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, both of which became major influences on the composer's later work.
p36
aVSignificantly more complex than his other works for prepared piano, Sonatas and Interludes is generally recognized as one of Cage's finest achievements.
p37
aVThe cycle consists of sixteen sonatas (thirteen of which are cast in binary form, the remaining three in ternary form) and four more freely structured interludes.
p38
aVThe aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent emotions of the rasa Indian tradition.
p39
aVIn Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions to a new level of complexity.
p40
aVIn each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the work and that of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.
