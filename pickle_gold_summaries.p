VAce Books is the oldest active specialty publisher of science fiction and fantasy books.
p28
aVThe American company was founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn and began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns.
p29
aVIt soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953.

p145
aVHis extension of Fermi's theory of beta decay (in the form of the so-called Gamow\u2013Teller transitions) provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory.

p155
aVHe was a vigorous advocate of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
p156
aVThroughout his life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality, and is considered one of the inspirations for the character Dr. Strangelove in the 1964 movie of the same name.
