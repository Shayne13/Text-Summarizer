<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Edward Teller (Hungarian: TellerEde; January 15, 1908 September 9, 2003) was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist, known colloquially as "the father of the hydrogen bomb", even though he claimed he did not care for the title.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Teller made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (the JahnTeller and RennerTeller effects), and surface physics.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>His extension of Fermi's theory of beta decay (in the form of the so-called GamowTeller transitions) provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The JahnTeller effect and the BET theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Teller also made contributions to ThomasFermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Teller emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, and was an early member of the Manhattan Project charged with developing the first atomic bombs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>During this time he made a serious push to develop the first fusion-based weapons as well, but these were deferred until after World War II.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>After his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former Los Alamos colleague J. Robert Oppenheimer, Teller was ostracized by much of the scientific community.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>He was a co-founder of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and was both its director and associate director for many years.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In his later years he became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using thermonuclear explosive in what was called Project Chariot.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>He was a vigorous advocate of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Throughout his life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality, and is considered one of the inspirations for the character Dr. Strangelove in the 1964 movie of the same name.</a>
