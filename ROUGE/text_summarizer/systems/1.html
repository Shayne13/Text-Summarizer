<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The proportions were chosen arbitrarily in all but the last four pieces in the cycle: sonatas XIII and XVI use symmetrical proportions, and sonatas XIV and XV share the 2, 2, 3, 3 proportion.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Work on the project was interrupted in early 1947, when Cage made a break to compose The Seasons, a ballet in one act also inspired by ideas from Indian philosophy.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several nuts and one eraser.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In his 1949 lecture on Sonatas and Interludes Pierre Boulez specifically emphasized the connection between tradition and innovation in Sonatas and Interludes: "The structure of these sonatas brings together a pre-Classical structure and a rhythmic structure which belong to two entirely different worlds."</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The first two are free-form movements, whereas interludes 3 and 4 have a four-section structure with repeats for each section.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It was composed in 19461948, shortly after Cage's introduction to Indian philosophy and the teachings of art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, both of which became major influences on the composer's later work.</a>
