<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as the chair of the Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and later headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible (the TRIGA).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and developmentin fact, he stepped down from the directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>After conveying the matter to the U.S. government, Teller reportedly said: "They [Israeli] have it, and they were clever enough to trust their research and not to test, they know that to test would get them into trouble."</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It took a year for Teller to convince the CIA that Israel had obtained nuclear capability; the information then went through CIA Director Richard Helms and then to the US president at that time, Lyndon B. Johnson.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>He was Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (19581960), which he helped to found (along with Ernest O. Lawrence), and after that he continued as an Associate Director.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In his later years he became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using thermonuclear explosive in what was called Project Chariot.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In 1967 when the Israeli nuclear program was nearing completion, Teller informed Neeman that he was going to tell the CIA that Israel had built nuclear weapons and explain that it was justified by the background of the Six-Day War.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley.</a>
