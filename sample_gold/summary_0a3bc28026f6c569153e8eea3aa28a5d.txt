J.R.R.
Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is a 1978 American fantasy film directed by Ralph Bakshi.
It uses a hybrid of traditional cel animation and rotoscoped live action footage.
It is an adaptation of the first half of the high fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings (1954–55) by English novelist J. R. R. Tolkien.
Set in Middle-earth, the film follows a group of hobbits, elves, men, dwarves, and wizards who form a fellowship.
They embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron, and ensure his destruction.
The film features the voices of William Squire, John Hurt, Michael Graham Cox, and Anthony Daniels of Star Wars fame, and was one of the first animated films to be presented theatrically in the Dolby Stereo sound system.
The screenplay was written by Peter S. Beagle, based on an earlier draft by Chris Conkling.
Director Ralph Bakshi encountered Tolkien's writing early in his career, and had made several attempts to produce The Lord of the Rings as an animated film before being given funding by producer Saul Zaentz and distributor United Artists.
The film is notable for its extensive use of rotoscoping, a technique in which scenes are first shot in live-action, then traced onto animation cels.
Although the film was a financial success, it received a mixed reaction from critics and there was no sequel to cover the remainder of the story.
Nonetheless, the film was an influence on Peter Jackson, who details his debt in the 'extras' of the DVD to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.
