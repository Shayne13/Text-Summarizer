<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the fall the war was always there, but we did not go to it any more</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We were all at the hospital every afternoon, and there were different ways of walking across the town through the dusk to the hospital</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Always, though, you crossed a bridge across a canal to enter the hospital</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Beyond the old hospital were the new brick pavilions, and there we met every afternoon and were all very polite and interested in what was the matter, and sat in the machines that were to make so much difference</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> But it did not bend yet, and instead the machine lurched when it came to the bending part</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In the next machine was a major who had a little hand like a baby's</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> The doctor went to his office in a back room and brought a photograph which showed a hand that had been withered almost as small as the major's, before it had taken a machine course, and after was a little larger</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> The major held the photograph with his good hand and looked at it very carefully</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> We only knew then that there was always the war, but that we were not going to it any more</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> We were all a little detached, and there was nothing that held us together except that we met every afternoon at the hospital</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> The major, who had been a great fencer, did not believe in bravery, and spent much time while we sat in the machines correcting my grammar</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> The major came very regularly to the hospital</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> There was a time when none of us believed in the machines, and one day the major said it was all nonsense</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> He was a small man and he sat straight up in his chair with his right hand thrust into the machine and looked straight ahead at the wall while the straps thumbed up and down with his fingers in them</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> Then he looked down at the machine and jerked his little hand out from between the straps and slapped it hard against his thigh</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> When he came back into the room, I was sitting in another machine</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> He was wearing his cape and had his cap on, and he came directly toward my machine and put his arm on my shoulder</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> The doctor told me that the major's wife, who was very young and whom he had not married until he was definitely invalided out of the war, had died of pneumonia</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> The major did not come to the hospital for three days</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20> In front of the machine the major used were three photographs of hands like his that were completely restored</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21> I do not know where the doctor got them</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22></a>
