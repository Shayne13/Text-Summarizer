       "  32: 'He was finally forced to flee France during the Affair of the Placards in mid-October 1534.',\n",
       "  33: 'In that incident, unknown reformers had posted placards in various cities attacking the Catholic mass, which provoked a violent backlash against Protestants.',\n",

       "  43: 'In August he set off for Strasbourg, a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire and a refuge for reformers.',\n",
       "  44: 'Due to military manoeuvres of imperial and French forces, he was forced to make a detour to the south, bringing him to Geneva.',\n",
       "  45: 'Calvin had only intended to stay a single night, but William Farel, a fellow French reformer residing in the city, implored a most reluctant Calvin to stay and assist him in work of reforming the church there it was his duty before God, Farel insisted.',\n",

       "  50: 'And when he realized that I was determined to study in privacy in some obscure place, and saw that he gained nothing by entreaty, he descended to cursing, and said that God would surely curse my peace if I held back from giving help at a time of such great need.',\n",
       "  51: 'Terrified by his words, and conscience of my own timidity and cowardice, I gave up my journey and attempted to apply whatever gift I had in defense of my faith.',\n",
       "  52: 'Calvin accepted without any preconditions on his tasks or duties.',\n",
       "  53: 'The office to which he was initially assigned is unknown.',\n",
       "  54: 'He was eventually given the title of \"reader\", which most likely meant that he could give expository lectures on the Bible.',\n",
       "  55: 'Sometime in 1537 he was selected to be a \"pastor\", although he never received any pastoral consecration.',\n",
       "  56: 'For the first time, the lawyer-theologian took up pastoral duties such as baptisms, weddings, and church services.',\n",
       "  57: 'Throughout the fall of 1536, Farel drafted a confession of faith while Calvin wrote separate articles on reorganizing the church in Geneva.',\n",

       "  59: 'The document described the manner and frequency of their celebrations of the eucharist, the reason for and the method of excommunication, the requirement to subscribe to the confession of faith, the use of congregational singing in the liturgy, and the revision of marriage laws.',\n",
       "  60: 'The council accepted the document on the same day.',\n",
       "  61: \"Throughout the year, however, Calvin and Farel's reputation with the council began to suffer.\",\n",
       "  62: 'The council was reluctant to enforce the subscription requirement, as only a few citizens had subscribed to their confession of faith.',\n",
       "  63: 'On 26 November, the two ministers heatedly debated the council over the issue.',\n",
       "  64: 'Furthermore, France was taking an interest in forming an alliance with Geneva and as the two ministers were Frenchmen, councillors began to question their loyalty.',\n",
       "  65: \"Finally, a major ecclesiastical-political quarrel developed when Bern, Geneva's ally in the reformation of the Swiss churches, proposed to introduce uniformity in the church ceremonies.\",\n",
       "  66: 'One proposal required the use of unleavened bread for the eucharist.',\n",
       "  67: \"The two ministers were unwilling to follow Bern's lead and delayed the use of such bread until a synod in Zurich could be convened to make the final decision.\",\n",
       "  68: 'The council ordered Calvin and Farel to use unleavened bread for the Easter eucharist; in protest, the ministers did not administer communion during the Easter service.',\n",

       "  77: 'By September 1538 Calvin had taken up his new position in Strasbourg, fully expecting that this time it would be permanent; a few months later, he applied for and was granted citizenship of the city.',\n",
       "  78: 'During his time in Strasbourg, Calvin was not attached to one particular church, but held his office successively in the Saint-Nicolas Church, the Sainte-Madeleine Church and the former Dominican Church, renamed the Temple Neuf.',\n",

       "  86: 'In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen.',\n",
       "  87: 'He concurrently worked on another book, the Commentary on Romans, which was published in March 1540.',\n",
       "  88: 'The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition.',\n",
       "  89: 'In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.',\n",
       "  90: \"Calvin's friends urged him to marry.\",\n",

       "  105: 'An embassy reached Calvin while he was at a colloquy, a conference to settle religious disputes, in Worms.',\n",
       "  106: 'His reaction to the suggestion was one of horror in which he wrote, \"Rather would I submit to death a hundred times than to that cross on which I had to perish daily a thousand times over.\"',\n",

       "  113: 'The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons to care for the poor and needy.',\n",
       "  114: 'They also called for the creation of the Consistoire (Consistory), an ecclesiastical court composed of the lay elders and the ministers.',\n",
       "  115: 'The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction.',\n",
       "  116: 'Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty.',\n",
